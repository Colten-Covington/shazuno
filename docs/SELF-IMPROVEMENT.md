# AI Agent Self-Improvement Guide

## Introduction

This document establishes a **self-improvement protocol** for AI agents working on the Shazuno codebase. After completing any task, agents should take time to reflect, learn, and improve the documentation for future agents.

> **Philosophy:** Every completed task is an opportunity to make the next task easier. By documenting learnings and updating guidance, we create a continuously improving system.

## Why Self-Improvement Matters

### The Problem
Without active documentation maintenance:
- Patterns get forgotten and re-discovered
- Anti-patterns repeat across the codebase
- Context is lost between sessions
- New agents make the same mistakes
- Documentation becomes outdated

### The Solution
Proactive self-improvement:
- ✅ Captures learnings while fresh
- ✅ Documents patterns immediately
- ✅ Prevents future mistakes
- ✅ Builds institutional knowledge
- ✅ Makes future work faster

## When to Self-Improve

### **MANDATORY: After EVERY Task** ⚠️

Self-improvement is **NOT OPTIONAL**. After completing ANY task:

1. ✅ **Verify changes** (git status, git diff)
2. ✅ **Update documentation** (minimum: one AGENTS.md file)
3. ✅ **Add real examples** (from actual code changes)
4. ✅ **Document learnings** (patterns, anti-patterns)

**Do not wait to be prompted. This is automatic.**

### Always After:
- Completing a feature or refactoring
- Fixing a bug (document the root cause)
- Discovering an anti-pattern
- Learning a new pattern or best practice
- Making architectural decisions

### Especially After:
- Multi-file refactorings
- Architecture changes
- Creating new layers or abstractions
- Solving complex problems
- Debugging non-obvious issues

## The Self-Improvement Process

### Step 0: **VERIFY CHANGES ACTUALLY EXIST** ⚠️

**CRITICAL: Do this BEFORE writing any summaries or commit messages!**

```bash
# 1. Check what actually changed
git status

# 2. Review the actual diff
git diff

# 3. For new files, verify they exist
ls -la path/to/new/file

# 4. Run build to ensure no errors
pnpm build
```

**Never write commit messages or summaries before verifying changes exist!**

### Step 1: Analyze What Was Done

Ask yourself:
- **What changed?** List files modified and why (based on git diff!)
- **What was the problem?** Root cause, not just symptoms
- **What was the solution?** High-level approach
- **What alternatives were considered?** Why this approach won

Example from this project:
```
Problem: useSunoSongs hook called lib directly, bypassing service caching
Solution: Refactored to use sunoService which provides 5-minute cache
Impact: Reduced API calls by ~90% for repeated username queries
```

### Step 2: Identify Learnings

Extract generalizable patterns:

#### What Worked Well?
- Architecture patterns that proved valuable
- Code organization that improved clarity
- Performance optimizations that worked
- Debugging techniques that helped

#### What Didn't Work?
- Anti-patterns discovered
- Initial approaches that failed
- Misconceptions corrected
- Code smells identified

#### What Was Learned?
- New patterns or techniques
- Better understanding of existing systems
- Trade-offs and their implications
- Best practices validated

### Step 3: Document the Learnings

Update documentation to preserve insights:

#### 3.1 Update Relevant AGENTS.md Files

**Root AGENTS.md** - Update for project-wide patterns
**Directory AGENTS.md** - Update for area-specific patterns

Add:
- ✅ **Architecture guidance** with diagrams
- ✅ **Real code examples** from the codebase
- ✅ **Comparison tables** (before/after, good/bad)
- ✅ **Anti-patterns** with explanations
- ✅ **Best practices** with rationale

Example from hooks/AGENTS.md:
```markdown
## Architecture Layering ⚠️

**Correct Pattern:**
Hook → Service → Lib → API

**Example from this codebase:**
✅ CORRECT: useSunoSongs uses sunoService (gets caching)
❌ WRONG: useSunoSongs calls fetchAllSunoSongs directly (no caching)
```

#### 3.2 Update Architecture Documentation

**docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - For system-wide architecture changes
**docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md** - For reusable patterns
**docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md** - For coding standards

Add:
- Detailed explanations with diagrams
- Real-world examples from the codebase
- Benefits and trade-offs
- When to use vs when not to use

#### 3.3 Add Code Comments

For complex or non-obvious code:
```typescript
/**
 * Uses sunoService instead of lib directly to enable caching.
 * Service provides 5-minute TTL cache, reducing API calls.
 * See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for layering details.
 */
const songs = await sunoService.fetchUserSongs(username);
```

### Step 4: Make It Actionable

Good documentation is:

#### ✅ Specific and Concrete
- Use real examples from the codebase
- Show actual code, not abstract concepts
- Reference specific files and line numbers

#### ✅ Comparison-Based
- Show correct vs incorrect side-by-side
- Explain why one is better
- Highlight the consequences of each approach

#### ✅ Searchable
- Use keywords developers will search for
- Add tags or labels
- Cross-reference related documentation

#### ✅ Contextual
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Document the reasoning and trade-offs
- Link to related patterns or decisions

### Step 5: Verify Improvements

## Real Examples from This Project

### Example 1: Architecture Layering

**What was done:**
Refactored `useSunoSongs` hook to use `sunoService` instead of calling `lib/suno` directly.

**What was learned:**
- Hooks should call services, not lib directly
- Services provide caching and business logic
- Clear layering: lib → services → hooks → components

**How it was documented:**
1. Updated `hooks/AGENTS.md` with architecture diagram
2. Updated `services/AGENTS.md` with caching patterns
3. Updated `lib/AGENTS.md` to clarify low-level purpose
4. Added comprehensive section to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Result:**
Future agents now have clear guidance on:
- Where to put caching logic (services)
- How to structure data flow (layered)
- Why this pattern matters (performance)

### Example 2: Hook Initialization

**What was done:**
Fixed bug where `useSunoSongs()` didn't load songs on mount because no initial username was provided.

**What was learned:**
- Hooks with useEffect need initial values to trigger on mount
- Empty string doesn't trigger `if (value)` checks
- Pass initial parameters: `useSunoSongs(DEFAULT_SUNO_USERNAME)`

**How it was documented:**
1. Added "Hook Initialization Best Practice" section to `hooks/AGENTS.md`
2. Showed correct vs incorrect patterns side-by-side
3. Explained the useEffect dependency chain
4. Provided template for data-loading hooks

**Result:**
Future agents won't make the same initialization mistake.

### Example 3: Constants Organization

**What was done:**
Extracted hardcoded values into domain-organized constant modules.

**What was learned:**
- Group constants by domain (api, timing, ui, etc.)
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE naming
- Add JSDoc comments for clarity
- Central export via index.ts

**How it was documented:**
1. Created `constants/AGENTS.md` with patterns
2. Listed all constant modules and their purposes
3. Showed naming conventions
4. Provided usage examples

**Result:**
Future constants follow consistent organization.

```

### Measuring Improvement

Track these metrics informally:
- **Time to onboard** - How long to understand the codebase?
- **Repeat mistakes** - Are the same errors made again?
- **Documentation usage** - Do agents reference the docs?
- **Context retention** - How much is remembered between sessions?

### Continuous Refinement

Documentation is never "done":
- Update as patterns evolve
- Remove outdated guidance
- Consolidate duplicate information
- Improve clarity based on confusion
- Add more examples as code grows

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Documenting Too Late
**Problem:** Waiting until "later" to document
**Impact:** Context is lost, details forgotten
**Solution:** Document immediately after completing work

### ❌ Abstract Documentation
**Problem:** Generic examples without real code
**Impact:** Hard to apply to actual situations
**Solution:** Always use examples from the codebase

### ❌ Isolated Documentation
**Problem:** Updates that don't cross-reference
**Impact:** Information silos, hard to discover
**Solution:** Link related documentation together

### ❌ Planning Without Implementation
**Problem:** Writing detailed plans and summaries without making actual changes
**Impact:** False progress reports, misleading commit messages, wasted time
**Solution:** Always run `git status` and `git diff` BEFORE writing summaries

### ❌ Unverified Examples
**Problem:** Code examples that don't work or files that don't exist
**Impact:** Loss of trust, wasted debugging time
**Solution:** Test all code examples, verify files exist

### ❌ No Anti-Patterns
**Problem:** Only showing the "right way"
**Impact:** Agents repeat mistakes without warnings
**Solution:** Document what NOT to do and why

### ❌ Orphaned Documentation
**Problem:** Documentation not linked from anywhere
**Impact:** Nobody finds or uses it
**Solution:** Link related documentation together

## Common Agent Failure Patterns

### 🚫 Failure Pattern 1: Writing Summaries Without Verification

**What happens:**
1. Agent makes a plan to create files
2. Agent writes detailed summary claiming files were created
3. Agent writes commit message describing changes
4. BUT: No actual code changes were made (git status shows clean)

**Prevention:**
```bash
# ALWAYS do this before claiming completion:
git status          # Check if changes exist
git diff            # Review actual changes
ls -la file.tsx     # Verify new files exist
pnpm build          # Ensure no errors
```

### 🚫 Failure Pattern 2: Forgetting Self-Improvement

**What happens:**
1. Agent completes a task successfully
2. Agent commits code changes
3. Agent forgets to update documentation
4. Learnings are lost, patterns not documented

**Prevention:**
- Self-improvement is MANDATORY after every task
- Not optional, not prompted
- Minimum: update one AGENTS.md file with real example

### 🚫 Failure Pattern 3: Using Hypothetical Examples

**What happens:**
1. Agent writes documentation with made-up examples
2. Examples don't match actual codebase
3. Future agents get confused

**Prevention:**
- Only use REAL code from the actual codebase
- Reference specific files and line numbers
- Test that examples actually work

## Quick Reference

### Minimum Self-Improvement

At minimum, after every task:
1. ✅ Identify one learning or pattern
2. ✅ Update one AGENTS.md file
3. ✅ Add one real code example
4. ✅ Verify it's accurate

### Full Self-Improvement

For significant work:
1. ✅ Complete post-task reflection
2. ✅ Update multiple AGENTS.md files
3. ✅ Update architecture documentation
4. ✅ Add multiple examples and anti-patterns
5. ✅ Create templates or checklists
6. ✅ Cross-reference all updates
7. ✅ Verify everything works

### When to Skip

Skip self-improvement only for:
- Trivial changes (typo fixes)
- Changes that don't establish patterns
- Pure deletion without replacement
- Emergency hotfixes (but document later!)

## Conclusion

Self-improvement is not extra work—it's an investment that pays dividends. Every minute spent documenting saves hours for future agents. By consistently applying this protocol, we create a codebase that becomes easier to work with over time, not harder.

**Remember:** You are not just writing code for now. You are writing documentation for future you and future agents. Make it easy for them!
